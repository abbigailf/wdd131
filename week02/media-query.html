            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p>27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they
                may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they
                humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto
                them.</p>

            <h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
            <p>12 And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the
                Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devel shall send forth his mighty
                winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon
                you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because
                of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build
                they cannot fall.</p>
